## Project Description

**EasyLang** is a minimalist interpreted programming language designed to simplify algorithmic learning for students and hobbyists.  
It emphasizes **simplicity, readability, and performance**, allowing users to explore programming and algorithmic thinking without the complexity of modern language syntax.  

The interpreter (`easylang.c`) is lightweight, fast, and suitable for experimentation and educational purposes. EasyLang draws from embedded systems and scripting automation principles, making it efficient even on resource-constrained environments.
